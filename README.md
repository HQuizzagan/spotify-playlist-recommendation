# spotify-playlist-recommendation
It's an app that allows you to extract information about a PUBLIC PLAYLIST and the contained AUDIO TRACKS in it. Using the tracks' SPOTIFY IDs, you can also extract their corresponding AUDIO FEATURES, which in turn can be used as SEED TRACKS for generating up to 50 recommended tracks based on danceability, energy, and valence of the selected seeds.
